The open source IRC tools and bots collection! Snipes is a IRC bot and a IRC bot API. It has three subprojects: the Snipes IRC API, a way to create simple event-based IRC bots; the Snipes IRC bot, a IRC bot with a plugin API; and the Snipes NoIRCMan console, a client for one of the core plugins of Snipes.

Snipes is licensed under the GPLv3.

Snipes is currently a one-man project, but I'm looking for people to help! Just send me a email at auv5@ymail.com.
